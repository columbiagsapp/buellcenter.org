## Implementation Notes

### Homepage

Any type of content, organized by a node queue

### Research and Programs

Menu is made up of all taxonomy items from the Research and Programs vocabulary (defined by a view that creates a block that is set to the left sidebar).

Menu clicks through to a custom content type with a tpl.php template that lists all the Research and Programs nodes in the chosen taxonomy in reverse chronological order.

User can then click through to an individual node.

### Conferences (/conferences)

A node queue view that accepts nodes of type conference.
